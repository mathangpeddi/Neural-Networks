ANNs are used for classification or business type problems but CNNs are used in computer vision applications
So the major libraries which we use here are tensorflow and keras which are very essential for deep learning.
The above 2 libraries help in builiding neural networks but for deep neueral networks they can be used but require a lot of lines of code thats why we go for keras library.

This business problem is a classification problem regarding customers of the bank,in the past 6 months many customers have exitted the company and we dont know the reason behind it
We have to build a model to find the reason and we have many independent variables and exitted is the dependent variable
So this is a binary outcome one(as this is a classification problem),we are trying to predict the exitted based on all the independent variables.

For the Convolutional Neural Networks the dataset contains the images of cats and dogs.The dataset consists of 5000 images.As it it a deep learning model its better to take a large dataset.Then we train it on the trainin set and then test it on the test set and finally predict if the image is a cat of a dog.
